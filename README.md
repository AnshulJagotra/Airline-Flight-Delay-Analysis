# Airline-Flight-Delay-Analysis

This project analyzes airline flight delay data to identify key insights regarding average delays per airline, most delayed routes, and potential seasonal or weather impacts.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate data analysis and visualization skills using a dataset of airline flight routes. Due to the size of a typical flight delay dataset, this analysis is performed on a subset of the data or a similar publicly available dataset suitable for processing in a non-distributed environment like Google Colab.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** Programming language for data analysis.
*   **Pandas:** Library for data manipulation and analysis.
*   **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Libraries for data visualization.
*   **Google Colab:** Environment for running the analysis.

## Analysis Steps

The analysis follows these key steps:

1.  **Data Loading:** Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2.  **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Handling missing values and preparing the data for analysis.
3.  **Average Delay by Airline:** Calculating and visualizing the average delay for each airline.
4.  **Most Delayed Routes:** Identifying and visualizing the top most delayed routes.
5.  **Seasonal/Weather Impact Analysis (if applicable):** Exploring potential correlations between delays and time of year or weather conditions.

## How to Run the Code

1.  Open the project notebook in Google Colab.
2.  Ensure you have access to the dataset (either by downloading it or using a provided link).
3.  Run the code cells sequentially to perform the data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Future Improvements

*   Analyze a larger dataset using distributed computing tools like Spark or Dask.
*   Integrate external weather data to perform a more comprehensive weather impact analysis.
*   Build a predictive model to forecast flight delays.
